# Overview

As a software engineer, I am working to deepen my understanding of programming concepts by creating functional software applications. This project is a calculator written in C++ that demonstrates the language's syntax and features.

The software performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also has the ability to record the calculation history in a file, allowing users to review previous calculations.

My purpose for writing this software is to practice C++ programming, including concepts such as user input validation, file handling, and function definitions.

# Development Environment

I developed this software using Visual Studio Code as my code editor. The C++ programming language was used, utilizing the standard libraries for input/output operations and file handling. 

The main libraries included are:
- `<iostream>` for console input and output
- `<fstream>` for file operations
- `<limits>` for input validation
- `<string>` for handling strings

# Useful Websites

Here are some resources that I found helpful while working on this project:

- [C++ Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
- [w3schools for practice](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)
- [GeeksforGeeks C++ Tutorials](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/)

# Future Work

Some improvements and features I plan to add in the future:

- Implement more advanced mathematical functions (e.g., square root, exponentiation).
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
- Enhance error handling and input validation for more robust operation.
